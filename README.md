# The-Resistance

Currently a work in progress.

From the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistance_(game)):  
The Resistance is a game where players attempt to deduce one another's identities. 
 It is similar in structure to party games such as Mafia and Werewolf, 
where a small, secret group of informed players attempt to disrupt a larger uninformed group, while the larger group attempts
to identify the spies and eliminate them.

###Progress
So far, only the game lobby logic has been implemented using Firebase. Players can create, join, and leave games; the player list 
is sychronized across all users in the same session.
